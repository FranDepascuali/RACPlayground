//: ## Introduction
//: Hey there! Welcome to this [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) tutorial! The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the concepts behind ReactiveCocoa. Throughout this tutorial you will be able to play with it.
//:
//: First, make sure you run the the script bootstrap and you built the project. No errors should be displayed.
//:
//: ----
//: ## Framework Overview
//: ReactiveCocoa(RAC) is a framework that â€œprovides APIs for composing and transforming streams of values over time." The first time I read this definition I didn't understand what it meant, so let's break it into smaller pieces:
//:* Provides APIs: Provides us functions
//:* for composing and transforming
//:* streams of values over time: multiple values that will be received at uncertain moments.
//:
//: So, in plain english, ReactiveCocoa provides us functions for composing and transforming multiple values that will be received at uncertain moments. I like to see it as a way to discretize events.
//: ### Origins
//: ReactiveCocoa comes from the Functional Reactive Programming(FRP) paradigm. 
//:
//: As wikipedia states:
//: > Programming paradigm for reactive programming (asynchronous dataflow programming) using the building blocks of functional programming (e.g. map, reduce, filter)
//:
//: In this official [Framework Overview](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/Documentation/FrameworkOverview.md) from ReactiveCocoa you can read a high-level description of the components. Please, go ahead and read the items **Events** and **Signal**, I'll wait here.
//:
//: Right, now you have a notion of what **Events** and **Signals** are, I'll try to explain it in my own words.
//:
//: ### Events
//: Events are the "representation that something has happened".
//:
//: We have four types of events:
//: * ***Next***: Provides a new value.
//: * ***Failed***: Indicates that an error occurred before the signal could finish.
//: * ***Completed***: Indicates that the signal finished successfully, and that no more values will be sent by the source.
//: * ***Interrupted***: Indicates that the signal has terminated due to cancellation.
//:
//: I know you are developers and may be thinking (give me some code!), so here we have the representation of **Event**:
//:
    public enum Event<Value, Error: ErrorType> {
    
        case Next(Value)
    
        case Failed(Error)
    
        case Completed
    
        case Interrupted
    }
//:
//: Event needs to know which type of *Value* it should emit in case of ***Next*** and also which type of error in case of ***Failed***. That's why it is parametrized with ***Value*** and ***Error: ErrorType***.
//:
//: We can have different streams of events:
//:* stream: ***Next(5) -> Next(3) -> Next(7) -> Completed*** (Three values and then a Completed).
//:* stream: ***Next("Hello") -> Next("World") -> Interrupted*** (Two values and then an Interrupted).
//:* stream: ***Next(true) -> Failed*** (A value and a Failed event).
//:* stream: ***Completed*** (Just a Completed event).
//:
//: [Next](@next)
