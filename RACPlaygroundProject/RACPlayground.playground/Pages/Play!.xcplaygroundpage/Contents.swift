//: # Play!
//:
//: We've learned the following concepts:
//: * **Event**
//: * **Signal**
//: * **SignalProducer**
//: * **Properties**
//: * **Action**
//:
//: And saw a use case for SignalProducer (UserRepository) and for Action (binding UIButtons).
//:
//: I encourage you to play a little bit with RAC. To experiment with its components.
//: Also, I think that it is mandatory that you read the [Documentation](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/tree/master/Documentation). It explains with more details the things that we've seen here.
//:
//: The next part of this tutorial will go in depth with more advanced concepts. We will cover
//: * Chaining asynchronous operations with RAC.
//: * Memory management while using RAC (scared?).
//: * Some advanced tips.
//:
//: If you've reached here, I feel really proud. It is quite difficult to write about a topic one already knows; I mean, I don't know if I'm going too slow or too fast, or if what I've written is clear enough. Also, English isn't my mother tongue, so probably there are lots of syntax errors (without Command failed due to signal: Segmentation Fault 11).
//:
//: Please, ANY feedback would be appreciated and you can contact me (francisco.depascuali@wolox.com.ar) or submit an issue [here](https://github.com/FranDepascuali/RACPlayground/issues) and also  feel free to [colaborate](https://github.com/FranDepascuali/RACPlayground).
//:
//: If you haven't used playgrounds before, you can do a lot of things. I use them sometimes to spot bugs (identify and isolate the problem, make an analogue case here and find the solution). So you can create Classes, Structs, Enums, use some features of `UIKit` (even draw a view), etc...
//:
//: One last comment, RAC is really difficult first. Once you grab the concepts and understand it, it really saves time and more important, it provides us more consistent code. So don't feel bad if you think it is Chinese right now; We've all been there.
//:
//: So, start playing! When you feel you are ready and familiar with the concepts, click on [next](@next) and we'll continue the tutorial.
